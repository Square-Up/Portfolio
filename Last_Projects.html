            <p>The goal of this project was to either create a game or an animation. My partner and I decided to create a game where the player would have to find other sprites, similar to a game of hide and seek. We first had to design how to make the sprites appear in certain places,then a timer counting down the time, and a point system for every time the player found a sprite. Once that was done, we added more levels and sprites, and changed the timer for the levels. Through this project, I learned how to split up work but still be able to collaborate with a partner efficiently.</p>

            <p>The aim of this was to develop an app. My partner and I decided we'd develop an app which allows you to draw. The first thing we had to get out of the way was getting the placement of the buttons and canvas right. After, we had to get the camera function to work. Once we did that, we added attributes to the buttons, like color selection, eraser, or clear canvas. After that, we decided to add a slider which allows the user to change the pen and eraser size. With this project, only one person could code at a time, so through this, I learned how to be able to be productive, even when not directly coding.</p>

            <p>The of this project was to manipulate images for a certain purpose. I decided to create images tailored to the cause of acceptance. The first thing that was done was finding the images that'd would be worked with. After finding these images, some manipulated images were made for testing purposes. Once more comfortable with the methods and needed code, borders and masks were added to the final products using Python. When that was done, the only thing left was to present the final products. This was the first project I worked solo on, so for this project instead of having to figure out how to distribute the work, I learned how to distribute my own time to be able to successfully finish the project without overworking myself during any one work session.</p>
