          <p>I am currently a Dublin High School student studying Computer Science Principles, but I'm aiming' to become a game artist in the future. Typically, I do artwork commissions with a few animation projects on the side, however, at the moment both commissions and animations are on a hold. During the current situation, with money being tight, I've open up art and edit trades in place of comissions. Whenever I'm not doing either of those things, I'm most likely either reading or simply drawing for the fun of it. I’ve always enjoyed implementing a more artistic side to more technical things, such as websites, so this goal is meant to help me acheive that.</p>

<p>An important skill to be able to accomplish everything I need to in a given time is time management. I’ve found that if I’ve scheduled and organized plans out, I can easily get through work without having to rush, resulting in better final products. If given the time to do these, I can be quite resourceful and diligent when it comes to work.</p> 

<p>I get commissions done as soon as possible and am dependable about getting projects done before deadlines. I’ve also learned to stay persistent and push through projects and work, even when I may be unmotivated. If an issue was to come up, I’m open-minded and flexible to trying out different ideas and solutions.</p> 

<p>Overall, I’m an independent worker who you can be sure to rely on. Thank you for reading through this, and feel free to take a look at the rest of this site.
