          <p>I am currently a Dublin High School student studying Principles of Engineering, however in the future I am aiming to go into cybersecurity. </p>

<p>An important skill to be able to accomplish everything needed in a given time is time management. I have found that if I have scheduled and organized plans out, I can easily get through work without having to rush, resulting in better final products. If given the time to do these, I can be quite resourceful and diligent when it comes to work.</p> 

<p> For some work experience, I do art commissions for clients. Clients want their final product as soon as possible, so I get commissions done in a timely manner and am dependable about getting projects done before deadlines. I have also learned to stay persistent and push through projects and work, even when I may feel unmotivated. If an issue comes up, I am open-minded and flexible to trying out different ideas and solutions.</p> 

<p>Overall, I am an independent worker who you can be sure to rely on. Thank you for reading through this, and feel free to take a look at the rest of this site.
